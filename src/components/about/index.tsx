            from Belo Horizonte, MG.
            <br />
            <br />I graduated as a graphic designer at INAP College, in 2011,
            and since then I have been working with branding, visual identity
            concept and creation of printed graphic pieces, but I love code and
            I migrate to UX/UI and dedicated myself as a front-end developer,
            and I have good skills in Html, Css, Javascript, with focus on React
            and Nextjs.
            <br />
            <br />I love people, technology, forests and &quot;p√£o de
