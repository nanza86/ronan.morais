            My name is Ronan Alves de Morais, I am 36 years old and Brazilian
            from Belo Horizonte, MG.
            <br />
            <br />I graduated as a graphic designer at INAP College, in 2011, and
            since then I have been working with branding, visual identity
            concept and creation of printed graphic pieces, but I love code and
            I dedicated myself as a front-end developer, and I have good skills
            in Html, Css, Javascript, with focus on React and Nextjs.
            <br />
            <br />I love people, technology, forests and &quot;p√£o de
